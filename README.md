I've learned that creating something from nothing is both frustrating and rewarding. 
Although the website is extremly basic, i've learned alot about programming like constant trial and errors most programmers will go through. 
I've defintely come to appreciate the time it takes to create complex websites, and how it can take over your daily life if you're not careful.
